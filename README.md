<h2 align="left">Hi üëã! My name is Matheus Blanco, and I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil.</h2>

I'm a software engineer passionate about building scalable, user-friendly applications across **web, front-end, back-end, and mobile**. With over 4 years of experience, I love turning ideas into products that make a positive impact, prioritizing **clean code, usability, and continuous learning** in every project I work on.

Here you will find some of my projects, experiments, and contributions that reflect my dedication to creating meaningful digital experiences.

üå± Currently learning advanced TypeScript patterns and system design. Also very interested on Flutter for mobile applications.  
üí° Always open to collaboration on impactful projects.  
‚ö° Fun fact: I also volunteer as a Scout leader, which helps me bring teamwork and leadership into my tech journey.

Feel free to connect and explore my repositories below! üöÄ
